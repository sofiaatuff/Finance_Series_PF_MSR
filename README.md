# Finance Series: Personal Finance 
## 1. Monthly Spending Reivew

The personal finance series represents my effort to maintain a record of my financial situation. Through the creation of tools, I aim to analyze and comprehend my expenditure patterns.

This marks the first installment of my personal finance series, in which I delve into a breakdown of my monthly spending. In my case, I rely on a single credit card for all my transactions.

I have discovered that regularly reviewing my spending habits enables me to contemplate my purchases, identifying which ones were worthwhile and which ones were not. I then apply the insights gained from this process to guide my financial decisions in the subsequent months.

In a world filled with clever marketing strategies and convenient one-click checkout experiences, it becomes a constant struggle to resist spending money on unnecessary items or fleeting indulgences.
